# Sarcasm Classification Comparison
### Sarcasm Detection - A Comparison Into How Linguistic Categorization and Modeling Affects Sarcastic Classifications
This repository holds a Jupyter notebook for an experimental study of different Scikit-Learn featurizers and their ability to classify sarcasm from Twitter and Reddit posts.

To run the notebook, click the "Run All" button within Google Colab. The fourth code block requires the user to upload the `kaggle_data_key.json` via the "Upload" button in the output box below the code cell. This will retrieve all necessary datasets from Kaggle to be used in the program.

##### NOTE: This notebook could take upwards of hours to run depending on hardware implementation (we had limited hardware resources, so it took us upwards of 10 hours to run)

<br>The `data` folder contains the data files used in the project; however, the files are downloaded remotely (this serves as a back-up copy)
<br>The `images` folder contains the resulting plots from running the code
<br>The `src` folder contains the Jupyter Notebook of the experimentation, Kaggle key, and the resulting final statistics generated by the notebook
<br>The final publication paper exists in this directory, having all files pertaining to the experiment and the report in one place (in this repository).
